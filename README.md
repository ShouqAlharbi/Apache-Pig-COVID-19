# Apache-Pig-COVID-19

we applied Pig Latin to the covid-19 dataset
First: we cleaned the dataset and publish the dataset after cleaning
Secondly, we made some questions to extract their answers from the huge data set.

Apache Pig is an open-source platform for data processing and analysis. It is an efficient tool for data manipulation and analysis, and it is used in many industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail. Apache Pig provides a data flow language called Pig Latin which allows developers to express complex data processing operations in a single line of code. This makes it extremely useful for analyzing large datasets and automating workflows. 
Furthermore, Apache Pig is easy to use, with a wide range of functions and libraries that are readily available. It is highly reliable and secure, and it supports multiple data formats such as CSV, JSON, Avro, and Parquet. 
Apache Pig is quickly becoming one of the most popular data processing platforms, and its capabilities make it an invaluable tool for any organization.

Pig Latin enables users to quickly define and execute data analysis operations without having to write complex Java MapReduce programs. With Pig Latin, users can write code faster and produce results more quickly. 
Apache Pig is an incredibly useful tool for data scientists, data analysts, and anyone else looking to quickly and easily handle large datasets. 
Not only does it make data analysis more efficient, but it also helps to reduce the complexity of data analysis operations and makes them more accessible to everyone.
